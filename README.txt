Running ~/.bash_profile at login time
on Mac OS X
by Quinn Weaver <quinn@fairpath.com>

    The problem

Mac OS X doesn't run ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile until you
actually run Terminal to start a shell.  This differs from the behavior of
GNU/Linux, where your bash init file is run as soon as you log in, even if you
do so via X11.

This is a problem if you want to run a daemon when you log in (say, ssh-agent
or gpg-agent, or a or a Ruby on Rails Webrick for your private version of an
app).

    The solution

I wrote an AppleScript wrapper that looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login,
and ~/.profile and runs the first one that exists and is readable.
That's what bash itself does on non-Mac systems.

You can set this AppleScript to run when you first log in.

    Installing

1) In the Finder, drag run_bash_login.app to your Dock.  This will make a Dock
icon for it, while also keeping the original file.

2) Right-click the Dock icon and select "Open at Login" from the options menu.

3) You may then, if you wish, drag the icon off of the Dock and onto the
desktop (where it will disappear in a puff of smoke).  Just remember where
the original file was, because you'll need to copy it back to the Dock
if you ever want to uninstall it.

    Uninstalling

A) Drag the app to the Dock, if it's not already there.  See the instructions
under 1), above.

B) Right-click the Dock icon and look for "Open at Login" under options.
It should have a checkbox.  If so, select it with your mouse, and the checkbox
will go away.

C) Drag the icon off of the Dock and onto the Desktop; this will make it
disappear.

D) If you wish, remove this directory.

    Manifest

run_bash_login.applescript   the AppleScript source code.
run_bash_login.app           the application bundle.

    Troubleshooting

In the unlikely even that the script doesn't work, try the following:

- Make sure your ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile)
is readable by you: run Terminal and do chmod u+r ~/.bash_profile.

- Add this line to the top of your ~/.bash_profile (or whatever):

touch ~/Desktop/bash_file_ran

Then double-click the app again.  If that file appears, then your bash file is
running, after all.  Of course, the commands in your file could be
failingâ€¦

- Open the source file, run_bash_login.applescript, in the AppleScript Editor
application, and press the Run button.  This should give you an informative
message as to what's going wrong.

- If you think there's something wrong with the app, please send me a bug
report.
